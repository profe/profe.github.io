  welcome: |
    I cannot begin to tell you how excited I am for this class! My first CS class at UC Irvine was rough, especially as the first in my family to go to college AND one of the few Chicanx/Latinx in the major.  Having almost no idea what CS was about (besides gaming and websites), not knowing what application programming is, and overall navigating a whole new school system...let’s just say it was rough! This class starts showing you something closer to the real world with GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces) and goes deeper into OOP (object-oriented programming). It’s going to be tough, but you’ll get a much better sense of what OOP is and what is possible with a well-planned project. Let’s see how we can accomplish this together!

    This course is a continuation of CS 111 - beginning Java. Students will explore advanced Computer Science concepts such as linked lists, array lists, exception handling, basic recursion and input/output (I/O) objects using the Java language. The student will learn the difference between a java application and a Java Applet, and the relationship between an applet and HTML (HypertextMarkupLanguage). Applets will be designed for the web using Java swing components, graphics objects, layout managers, and menu components. Students will continue to apply the basic concepts of object-oriented programming, namely, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism in designing user-defined classes and coding programs incorporating control structures, graphical elements and more complex data structures such as linked lists.

  outcomes:
    - You will be able to analyze designs incorporating more complex control structures and object-oriented design techniques which will result in appropriate solutions to specified problems.
    - You will be able to implement efficient, effective solutions to more complex programming problems. These solutions will incorporate the principles of inheritance and polymorphism, fault-tolerance through exception and error handling, utilize data files and implement more advanced data structures and associated algorithms.
    - You will be able to convey more advanced concepts of the object-oriented paradigm, describe more complex syntactic and program control structures, write more sophisticated programs as well as explain program designs verbally and in writing.
    - You will be able to work in a team, agree upon an organizational model, establish roles, and delegate tasks to develop object-oriented software designs and complete programming projects on time in a cooperative and collective manner.


  question: How does CS shape society and culture? How do we shape CS?

# Grade Policies
In this class we don't value perfection at a specific time, we value learning at our pace and getting to the finish line together. The policies below reflect that, and although they may be new to you and confusing at times, please trust they are flexible to accomodate our diverse set of students and are designed to support all of you! Please don't hesitate to ask me about the policies, specific examples, or where you are grade-wise at any point this semester!

## Deadlines
**The only hard deadline is at the end of week 16, for anything**. All deadlines for this course are guidelines to give you some structure, treat them as recommendations to help you keep up with the pace of the course materials. No matter what comes up this semester, you can automatically assume that you can take the extra time you need to submit anything! **No late penalties and unlimited resubmissions**, the whole point is to learn the material regardless of how much time it takes. Obviously, staying as close to those guidelines will ensure you don't fall behind as things inevitably pile up during the semester.

I’ll use the deadlines as a guide for keeping up with grading. I'll also use them to check in with you, so if you haven’t participated in the week's materials by those dates you can expect a message from me to see how I can help you keep up and thrive in our class!

## Grading
Our goal is for you to learn as much as you can in this course, and traditional grading can get in the way of that. That is why we’ll be using Specifications Grading, each assignment will tell you its exact requirements to get the grade you want.
- Each [Unit Deliverable](#unit-deliverable) (UD) will have a rubric stating the expectations for an EARN Grade: E (exemplary), A (acceptable), R (revision needed), and N (not assessable)
- Everything else, like labs, only earn a Complete (✓) or Incomplete (✘) for meeting the requirements provided

That means you’ll know exactly how to earn the grade you want, no mysteries or guessing! ALL parts of a row below must be met to earn that final grade. The requirements for each final course grades are below:

| To earn a(n): | [Unit Deliverables](#unit-deliverables) (UDs) - EARN-Es | [Unit Deliverables](#unit-deliverables) (UDs) - EARN-As | # Complete [Labs](#labs) | # Engagement Points (EPs) |
|---------------|---------------------------|--------|----------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| A    | >= 2 | == 4 | >= 11 | >= 45 |
| B    | >= 1 | == 4 | >= 10 | >= 40 |
| C/P  |      | == 4 | >= 9  | >= 35 |
| D/NP |      |  <4  | >= 8  | >= 25 |

***Note that to pass the course you MUST complete all UDs.*** Remember that you can resubmit any assignment multiple times, the feedback I provide will be specific to what is needed to receive a complete on that specific assignment.

## Engagement Points
From educational research, we know an engaged student is a learning student and leads to a successful student. The more engagement, the more likely you’ll thrive! You’ll have many opportunities through the semester to engage with CS materials, your classmates, and our community. We've designed the class so that **you basically get to choose how you learn and apply CS in your life!** Here are examples of the activities that qualify for engagement points:
- Course activities:
  - Fully completing OLI (course book) modules, meeting discussion post expectations, watching module overview videos, and (for on-ground courses only) partipcating in in-class activities
- Out-of-class activities (not required, just an option!):
  - Visiting the STEM Center for tutoring/drop-in hours, attending CS-supported club meetings/events, watching pre-recorded CS-support club events, attending campus events. You'll submit a form for these activities on what you learned and how you connect it to our course.

**Note that the total engagement points for a final course letter grade are based off of the most essential activities, *not requiring any out-of-class in-person activities.* Those options are there in case you’d rather earn engagement points another way!**



# How To Succeed
<img align="left" src="/images/syllabus/canvaslogo.png" alt="canvas logo" height="100" />
**All of the course material can be found through our Canvas course.** Each of the following are learning opportunities, the more thoughtfully you engage the more learning can happen! **In an asynchronous online course, we don’t have the usual weekly meetings. However, your flow each week will be similar except for the meeting time.** The following structure will help you keep up with the pace of the materials, but remember you always have me to check in with and I’ll be doing the same with you! Each week will go by this structure of Prepping for the new weeks topic, Applying it to a the week's problems, and Reflecting on your learning. See Canvas for each weeks specific topic materials and breakdown, below I'll describe these learning opportunities more generally:


## Prepping

### Article Readings
<img align="left" src="/images/syllabus/ztc-logo.png" alt="zero textbook cost logo" height="50" />
A weekly article on a real-world topic which on the surface may seem unrelated to Computer Science. You will be asked to think critically about the topic presented in the article, and write about the thoughts and feelings the article may have provoked, presenting evidence for any opinions you have about the subject of the article. This article will inform the weekly lab assignment, where in addition to the technical topics of the week, we will think about how computing is intertwined with real world issues.

### Discussion Posts
<img align="left" src="/images/syllabus/canvaslogo.png" alt="canvas logo" height="50" />
Following the articles, we can engage in class discussions through Canvas posts about the topics in the article and begin to connect them with the CS topics covered so far. If we can’t relate CS to our lives and the real world, how do we know we’re actually learning something useful?

### CS Topic Module
<img align="left" src="/images/syllabus/oli-logo.png" alt="open learning initiative logo" height="50" />
This is like your traditional book chapter reading. However, it's a weekly assigned technical topic module from OLI (Open Learning Initiative, a platform by Carnegie Mellon University) to cover at your own pace. You will have unlimited attempts on exercises in the module. **It’s recommended you take notes, create flashcards, or use any other study strategy to help absorb the contents of the module.** This will come in really handy for the practice work!


## Applying

### Weekly Lab Projects
<img align="left" src="/images/syllabus/github-logo.png" alt="github logo" height="50" />
A weekly graded lab assignment that will give you an opportunity to practice and apply the concepts and knowledge presented in the Topic Modules to a problem. Each lab has a set of requirements to meet for a Complete score. Grading feedback will specifically guide you on how to get to that Complete score to retry as many times as it takes! Most students get there after one, definitely by the second retry.

### Weekly Lab Demo Videos
<img align="left" src="/images/syllabus/demo-video.png" alt="instructor on computer in video" height="50" />
Instructional videos will be posted each week with explanations for key concepts and a coding demonstration walking you through the entire lab project to ensure full comprehension of the week's material. This is meant to support the learning objective, but also model for you how a software developer talks about code through the problem solving process (similar to what's expected in job interviews!)

### Unit Deliverables
<img align="left" src="/images/syllabus/unit-deliverable.jpg" alt="icon of a package" height="50" />
At the end of each unit you will be asked to demonstrate your understanding of that unit’s topics by completing part of your final project. Each UD has a list of requirements to meet for your personal project idea, the main requirement is incorporating all of the topics from the unit that builds toward your final project.

### Final Portfolio
<img align="left" src="/images/syllabus/portfolio.jpg" alt="icon of a portfolio" height="50" />
All UDs build toward this culminating project and presentation that will demonstrate your mastery of the topics covered this semester. The final project, like a capstone project, allows you to apply all that you have learned this semester.


## Reflecting

### Metacognitive Notes
<img align="left" src="/images/syllabus/personal-okr.png" alt="icon of a lightbulb on with mind inside" height="50" />
Metacognition can be thought of as *knowing about knowing* or *thinking about knowing*. In the context of education, we will take it to mean **thinking about learning**. At the end of each week you’ll be asked to reflect on your learning with respect to that week's material and activities. Practicing metacognition after every topic will improve your own understanding of the material and where you stand in terms of your own comprehension.

### Recommendations
It is strongly recommended you use the following resources as needed and as early as possible, **not just to pass the course but to *thrive*.** These good habits will definitely be expected of you as a CS major in more advanced courses!
- Review prep material by the start of the week, understanding whatever parts you didn’t before and ask questions on anything that is still unclear
- Visit the STEM Learning Center for tutoring appointments/drop-ins, this can be done for the prepwork, working on a lab, or better yet both! **I especially recommend tutoring appointments, they’re what got me through so many of my CS/STEM classes!**
- Use our communication platform to talk with other students and myself, get any questions answered (including extra/beyond material questions!)
- **Set up an appointment with me for a 1-on-1 breakdown of the material. *The best part of my job is interacting with students, it’s why I chose teaching over industry!***
