  welcome: |
    I cannot begin to tell you how excited I am for this class! My first CS class at UC Irvine was rough, especially as the first in my family to go to college AND one of the few Chicanx/Latinx in the major.  Having almost no idea what CS was about (besides gaming and websites), not knowing what application programming is, and overall navigating a whole new school system...let’s just say it was rough! This class starts showing you something closer to the real world with GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces) and goes deeper into OOP (object-oriented programming). It’s going to be tough, but you’ll get a much better sense of what OOP is and what is possible with a well-planned project. Let’s see how we can accomplish this together!

    This course is a continuation of CS 111 - beginning Java. Students will explore advanced Computer Science concepts such as linked lists, array lists, exception handling, basic recursion and input/output (I/O) objects using the Java language. The student will learn the difference between a java application and a Java Applet, and the relationship between an applet and HTML (HypertextMarkupLanguage). Applets will be designed for the web using Java swing components, graphics objects, layout managers, and menu components. Students will continue to apply the basic concepts of object-oriented programming, namely, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism in designing user-defined classes and coding programs incorporating control structures, graphical elements and more complex data structures such as linked lists.

  outcomes:
    - You will be able to analyze designs incorporating more complex control structures and object-oriented design techniques which will result in appropriate solutions to specified problems.
    - You will be able to implement efficient, effective solutions to more complex programming problems. These solutions will incorporate the principles of inheritance and polymorphism, fault-tolerance through exception and error handling, utilize data files and implement more advanced data structures and associated algorithms.
    - You will be able to convey more advanced concepts of the object-oriented paradigm, describe more complex syntactic and program control structures, write more sophisticated programs as well as explain program designs verbally and in writing.
    - You will be able to work in a team, agree upon an organizational model, establish roles, and delegate tasks to develop object-oriented software designs and complete programming projects on time in a cooperative and collective manner.


  question: How does CS shape society and culture? How do we shape CS?

# Grade Policies
In this class we don't value perfection at a specific time, we value learning at our pace and getting to the finish line together. The policies below reflect that, and although they may be new to you and confusing at times, please trust they are flexible to accomodate our diverse set of students and are designed to support all of you! Please don't hesitate to ask me about the policies, specific examples, or where you are grade-wise at any point this semester!

## Deadlines
**The only hard deadline is at the end of week 16, for anything**. All deadlines for this course are guidelines to give you some structure, treat them as recommendations to help you keep up with the pace of the course materials. No matter what comes up this semester, you can automatically assume that you can take the extra time you need to submit anything! **No late penalties and unlimited resubmissions**, the whole point is to learn the material regardless of how much time it takes. Obviously, staying as close to those guidelines will ensure you don't fall behind as things inevitably pile up during the semester.

I’ll use the deadlines as a guide for keeping up with grading. I'll also use them to check in with you, so if you haven’t participated in the week's materials by those dates you can expect a message from me to see how I can help you keep up and thrive in our class!

## Grading
Our goal is for you to learn as much as you can in this course, and traditional grading can get in the way of that. That is why we’ll be using Specifications Grading, each assignment will tell you its exact requirements to get the grade you want.
- Each [Unit Deliverable](#unit-deliverable) (UD) will have a rubric stating the expectations for an EARN Grade: E (exemplary), A (acceptable), R (revision needed), and N (not assessable)
- Everything else, like labs, only earn a Complete (✓) or Incomplete (✘) for meeting the requirements provided

That means you’ll know exactly how to earn the grade you want, no mysteries or guessing! ALL parts of a row below must be met to earn that final grade. The requirements for each final course grades are below:

| To earn a(n): | [Unit Deliverables](#unit-deliverables) (UDs) - EARN-Es | [Unit Deliverables](#unit-deliverables) (UDs) - EARN-As | # Complete [Labs](#labs) | # Engagement Points (EPs) |
|---------------|---------------------------|--------|----------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| A    | >= 2 | == 4 | >= 11 | >= 45 |
| B    | >= 1 | == 4 | >= 10 | >= 40 |
| C/P  |      | == 4 | >= 9  | >= 35 |
| D/NP |      |  <4  | >= 8  | >= 25 |

***Note that to pass the course you MUST complete all UDs.*** Remember that you can resubmit any assignment multiple times, the feedback I provide will be specific to what is needed to receive a complete on that specific assignment.



# How To Succeed
<img align="left" src="/images/syllabus/canvaslogo.png" alt="canvas logo" height="100" />
**All of the course material can be found through our Canvas course.** Each of the following are learning opportunities, the more thoughtfully you engage the more learning can happen! **In an asynchronous online course, we don’t have the usual weekly meetings. However, your flow each week will be similar except for the meeting time.** The following structure will help you keep up with the pace of the materials, but remember you always have me to check in with and I’ll be doing the same with you! Each week will go by this structure (see Canvas for each weeks specific topic materials and breakdown):

## Learning Opportunities
There are multiple assignment types to help you learn as much as you can this semester.  Please take full advantage of all opportunities provided. Your ideas and contributions are important and I hope you share them with us.

### Discussion Posts
<img align="left" src="/images/syllabus/ztc-logo.png" alt="zero textbook cost logo" height="50" />
These are opportunities to connect with your classmates, as well as with deeper concepts in the course.
- Usually based off a reading or video, all accessible online for free, no textbook cost for this class!
- Reflection questions are provided for you to answer, as well as details on providing thoughtful replies to your classmates posts

### Lab Exercises
<img align="left" src="/images/syllabus/snap-logo.png" alt="snap language logo" height="50" />
These assignments are a teaching tool to give you hands-on experience with a programming language (Snap!, a visual block language, and Python, a traditional typed language)
- For online courses, you can pair up with students you’d like to work with at your convenience
- A lab solution video, called a lab demo, is provided at the end of the week that contains the instructor walking step-by-step through one possible solution, going over the weeks concepts and connections to our industry

### Homework
<img align="left" src="/images/syllabus/python-logo.png" alt="python language logo" height="50" />
The purpose of the homework is to apply what you’ve learned through the labs on a more challenging problem.
- Larger projects and no solution (lab demo) videos are provided to assess your learning
- You can still collaborate and get support from your instructor and the STEM Center! Remember, you're not in this alone!

### Personal Objective and Key Results (OKR)
<img align="left" src="/images/syllabus/personal-okr.png" alt="logo of lightbulb on with brain inside" height="50" />
Customizing the class to fit your needs and goals. This goal can be personal, academic, career-oriented, the possibilities are endless!
- At the start of the semester you’ll set a goal or intent that aligns with the course
- Not programming (Snap!/Python) related, it can be but you’re encouraged to think outside the box! Not any course assignments either, something completely YOU!
- You’ll create milestones towards your objective that will be part of your final grade

### Final Project
<img align="left" src="/images/syllabus/colab-logo.png" alt="google colab logo" height="50" />
This culminating assignment will be a collection of your work demonstrating your mastery of the learning outcomes.  It will include...
- A programming project, in your choice of either Python or Snap!, that hits the main programming concepts of the course
- This project is proposed, designed, and built over the whole semester and introduces you to the *software development lifecycle*
- Your reflection of your learning and personal OKR
- A presentation of your course final project and OKR Assessment



## Recommendations
It is strongly recommended you use the following resources as needed and as early as possible, **not just to pass the course but to *thrive*.** These good habits will definitely be expected of you as a CS major in more advanced courses!
- Review prep material by the start of the week, understanding whatever parts you didn’t before and ask questions on anything that is still unclear
- Visit the STEM Learning Center for tutoring appointments/drop-ins, this can be done for the prepwork, working on a lab, or better yet both! **I especially recommend tutoring appointments, they’re what got me through so many of my CS/STEM classes!**
- Use our communication platform to talk with other students and myself, get any questions answered (including extra/beyond material questions!)
- **Set up an appointment with me for a 1-on-1 breakdown of the material. *The best part of my job is interacting with students, it’s why I chose teaching over industry!***
