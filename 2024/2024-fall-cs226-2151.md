  welcome: |
    I cannot begin to tell you how excited I am for this class! To be honest, I'm also super nervous. You see, this was the first class I failed at UCI. It was a blow to my over-achieving ego and, unfortunately, would not be the last. Luckily I retook it and passed, had a better experience in graduate school with a focus on formal logic, and haven't seen it since! So this semester will be a lot of learning, beyond the cheesy 'I learn from my students too' where I'll be recapping the material HEAVILY. Am I the only one sweating here? Phew...Luckily like all of my other classes, I value learning through community so we'll make the best out of this semester for sure!

# Grade Policies
In this class we don't value perfection at a specific time, we value learning at our pace and getting to the finish line together. The policies below reflect that, and although they may be new to you and confusing at times, please trust they are flexible to accomodate our diverse set of students and are designed to support all of you! Please don't hesitate to ask me about the policies, specific examples, or where you are grade-wise at any point this semester!

## Deadlines
All deadlines will be posted on Canvas for each assignment. Assignments like the Writing Project that do not have a deadline are due by end of Week 16 (to give time for final grading).You have unlimitted reattempts on self assessments until the deadline. 

For homework, programming projects, and PODs, you have 3 passes to use in the semester for a 1 week extension. You can use these at whatever time, just message/email me that you want to use a pass. No excuse or explanation is necessary, you decide if & when you want to use them!


## Grading
Our goal is for you to learn as much as you can in this course, and traditional grading can get in the way of that. That is why we’ll be using Specifications Grading, each assignment will tell you its exact requirements to get the grade you want.
- Each [Programming Project](#programming-projects) and [POD](#pods) you will have a rubric stating the expectations for an EARN Grade: E (exemplary), A (acceptable), R (revision needed), and N (not assessable). EARN-E and EARN-A grades are considered Complete(✓), the rest are considered Incomplete (✘)
- Everything else, like homework, earn a Complete (✓) or Incomplete (✘) for meeting the requirements provided

That means you’ll know exactly how to earn the grade you want, no mysteries or guessing! ALL parts of a row below must be met to earn that final grade. The requirements for each final course grades are below:

| To earn a(n): | [Programming Projects](#programming-projects) - EARN-As | [PODs](#pods) - EARN Grades | # Complete [Homework](#homework`) | # [EPs](#engagement-points) |
|---------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| A    | >= 4 | A or higher on 7, including >= 2 E's | >=7 | >= 65, including 1 writing project
| B    | >= 3 | A or higher on 6, including >= 1 E's | >=6 | >= 60
| C/P  | >= 3 | A or higher on 5                     | >=5 | >= 55
| D/NP | >= 2 |                                      | >=3 | >= 40

### EARN Grades
Here are more details on what an EARN grade entails:
- (E) Exemplary: Communication is clear and complete. Mastery of the concepts is evident. There are no nontrivial errors. This work could be used as a classroom example.
- (A) Acceptable: Understanding of the concepts is evident through correct work and clear explanations. Some revision or expansion is needed, but no significant gaps or errors are present. No additional instruction on the concepts is needed.
- (R) Revision Required: Partial understanding of the concepts is evident, but there are significant gaps that remain. Needs further work, more review, and/or improved explanations.
- (N) Not Assessable. Not enough information is present in the work to determine whether there is understanding of the concepts. The work is fragmentary or contains significant omissions. Or, there are too many issues to justify correcting each one.

## Engagement Points
Engagement Points (EPs) are earned for things like completing homework assignments, self-tests, participating in problem-solving sessions in-class, or posting research to the discussion board. There are also out-of-class opportunities like attending STEM Learning Center tutoring, office hours, and campus events. Each EP opportunity will be posted in Canvas.

**Note that the total engagement points for a final course letter grade are based off of the most essential activities, *not requiring any out-of-class in-person activities.* Those options are there in case you’d rather earn engagement points another way!**



# How To Succeed
<img align="left" src="/images/syllabus/canvaslogo.png" alt="canvas logo" height="100" />
**All of the course material can be found through our Canvas course.** Each of the following are learning opportunities, the more thoughtfully you engage the more learning can happen! **In an in-person course, your flow each week will be similar.** The following structure will help you keep up with the pace of the materials, but remember you always have me to check in with and I’ll be doing the same with you! Each week will go by this structure of Prepping for the new weeks topic, Applying it to a the week's problems, and Reflecting on your learning. Some weeks you'll also have homework, programming projects, and PODs to work on. See Canvas for each weeks specific topic materials and breakdown, below I'll describe these learning opportunities more generally:


## Prepping

### Lecture Videos
<img align="left" src="/images/syllabus/demo-video.png" alt="instructor on computer in video" height="50" />
Lecture videos each week cover the concepts we'll be using in class, make sure to watch them and take good notes along with any questions on parts you're confused on. You're not expected to know everything from these videos, but at least watching them means you're coming in to class with questions and some idea of what we're working on. It really helps as we put those things into practice together!

### Topic Readings
<img align="left" src="/images/syllabus/canvaslogo.png" alt="canvas logo" height="50" />
Section readings for the weeks topics, especially for a heavy math class, can be very overwhelming. A good tip is to skim through the reading and note any important formulas, vocab words, etc. so that you have an idea of where things are. If you have the time to go over it, especially after the lecture video, you'll have more questions and notes to work off of in class and for assignments. You can always come back to them after class to reflect on your learning, either as a reference for something specific or to go over again to see where gaps in your knowledge exist.


## Applying

### Practice Problems
<img align="left" src="/images/syllabus/demo-video.png" alt="instructor on computer in video" height="50" />
These are sample problems we'll do in class together. I'll ask students to try in class (EPs) each day and help each other so we can apply the concepts of the week. They'll be provided ahead of time in case you want to skim them to help with that in-person class anxiety/stress.

### Homework
<img align="left" src="/images/syllabus/unit-deliverable.jpg" alt="icon of a package" height="50" />
Homework is meant as additional practice of the concepts and sample problems after class. If you struggle with any of them, bring them to class for further discussion!

Some homework will be fully graded (complete/incomplete), while others you'll submit a survey about you completing it. See Canvas for details.

### Programming Projects
<img align="left" src="/images/syllabus/replit-logo.png" alt="replit logo" height="50" />
These assignments will link the discrete math content with computer applications.
- Projects can be written in C++, Java, or Python.
- Projects must be submitted in Replit

### PODs
<img align="left" src="/images/syllabus/portfolio.jpg" alt="icon of a portfolio" height="50" />
For take-home Performance Objective Demonstrations (PODs) you will be asked to show your mastery of the objective. This may include a theoretical discussion and/or solving problems. PODs will be evaluated on the [EARN Grades](#earn-grades) scale.

## Reflecting

### Self-Assessments
<img align="left" src="/images/syllabus/personal-okr.png" alt="icon of a lightbulb on with mind inside" height="50" />
These are another source of engagement points meant for you to self-check your learning. You can use them as practice/prep before class or reflection after class, either way you have unlimited attempts before the deadline.

### Recommendations
It is strongly recommended you use the following resources as needed and as early as possible, **not just to pass the course but to *thrive*.** These good habits will definitely be expected of you as a CS major in more advanced courses!
- Review prep material by the start of the week, understanding whatever parts you didn’t before and ask questions on anything that is still unclear
- Visit the STEM Learning Center for tutoring appointments/drop-ins, this can be done for the prepwork, working on a lab, or better yet both! **I especially recommend tutoring appointments, they’re what got me through so many of my CS/STEM classes!**
- Use our communication platform to talk with other students and myself, get any questions answered (including extra/beyond material questions!)
- **Set up an appointment with me for a 1-on-1 breakdown of the material. *The best part of my job is interacting with students, it’s why I chose teaching over industry!***
