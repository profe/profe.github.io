  welcome: |
    I cannot begin to tell you how excited I am for this class! It’s what I wish I had the first quarter at UC Irvine as the first in my family to go to college.  Having almost no idea what CS was about (besides gaming and websites), not knowing what application programming is, and overall navigating a whole new school system...let’s just say it was rough!  Luckily, you’re off to a great start by being in this class.  My job is to make sure that the whole semester is great to the very end. Whether you’re a CS major who’s never programmed, considering the major, or exploring and seeing what this whole computer thing is about, you are in the right place! Let’s see how we can accomplish this together!

  description: |
    This course introduces beginning or exploring students to core principles, theories, and topics in computer science while emphasizing their relevance in society. Topics include general computational problem-solving techniques, design of digital devices, how computers work, and how to design, implement, test, and document programs in both an interactive and a high-level programming language (Python). This course is highly recommended for students prior to taking a beginning programming class (CS 111, CS 150, CS 130, CS 138, or CS 155), non-computer science majors, or those interested in exploring computer science.

  outcomes:
    - You will be able to understand the breadth of Computer Science as a discipline and evaluate its impact on societal challenges and transformations.
    - You will be able to apply critical thinking to take a computational problem through the process of design, implementation, documentation, and testing.
    - You will be able to determine appropriate solutions to programming problems through analysis of programming fundamentals and application of computer science principles.
    - You will be able to work collaboratively and cooperatively in pairs to develop their understanding of computer science topics and principles, as well as create computer programs that implement proposed solutions.

  question: How does CS shape society and culture? How do we shape CS?

# Grade Policies
In this class we don't value perfection at a specific time, we value learning at our pace and getting to the finish line together. The policies below reflect that, and although they may be new to you and confusing at times, please trust they are flexible to accomodate our diverse set of students and are designed to support all of you! Please don't hesitate to ask me about the policies, specific examples, or where you are grade-wise at any point this semester!

## Deadlines
**The only hard deadline is at the end of week 16, for anything**. All deadlines for this course are guidelines to give you some structure, treat them as recommendations to help you keep up with the pace of the course materials. No matter what comes up this semester, you can automatically assume that you can take the extra time you need to submit anything! **No late penalties and unlimited resubmissions**, the whole point is to learn the material regardless of how much time it takes. Obviously, staying as close to those guidelines will ensure you don't fall behind as things inevitably pile up during the semester.

I’ll use the deadlines as a guide for keeping up with grading. I'll also use them to check in with you, so if you haven’t participated in the week's materials by those dates you can expect a message from me to see how I can help you keep up and thrive in our class!

## Grading
My goal is for you to learn as much as you can in this course, and traditional grading can get in the way of that. That is why we’ll be using Specifications Grading: each assignment will have a rubric stating the expectations for *Complete* (✓) and *Incomplete* (✘). That means you’ll know exactly how to earn the grade you want, no mysteries or guessing! As mentioned above in the [Deadlines](#deadlines) section, you have unlimited resubmissions to get the grade you’d like. You get to try until you get the grade you want at the end of the semester!

You need to get a *Complete* (✓) score on the number of assignments below. ALL of the row must be complete to earn that final grade. The requirements for each final course grades are below:

| To earn a(n): | # HW Programming Projects | # Labs | # Discussion Posts   | # Final Project Deliverables | # Parts of Personal OKR |
|---------------|---------------------------|--------|----------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| A    | 3 | >= 14 | >= 6 | All 4 | All 3 Parts |
| B    | 2 | >= 12 | >= 5 | All 4 | All 3 Parts |
| C/P  | 1 | >= 10 | >= 4 | All 4 | All 3 Parts |
| D/NP |   | >= 6  | >= 1 |       |             |

***Note that to pass the course, you MUST complete all parts for Final Project and Personal OKR.*** Remember that you can resubmit any assignment multiple times, the feedback I provide will be specific to what is needed to receive a complete on that specific assignment.
