This panel is the evolution of seven years of Technology that Educators of Computing Hail (TECH) Birds of a Feather sessions, grew into popular panels, and a regular column in ACM Inroads. Leveraging our experiences of teaching during the pandemic, many of us have incorporated technology we were forced to rely on during our time online, making for an even better experience for our students. This forum will provide a chance for a seasoned middle school, high school, community college, and university educator to showcase the technologies they can't live without, what problems they solve, and how to use them.
