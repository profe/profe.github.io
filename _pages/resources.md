## Student Communities
You’ll be learning a lot each semester, but you don’t have to do it alone! The following are some awesome organizations and clubs our department supports:

### ASE Programs

The MESA program is open to all students who meet the eligibility criteria: 1st gen college student, intent to transfer to a 4-year institution, declared in a calculus-based STEM field, have no previous Bachelor’s degree in any field, demonstrate financial need (such as qualifying for a PELL grant, Cal Grant, CA DREAM Act, GI Bill, Federal Work Study, Cal Fresh, or other need-based/subsidized Financial Aid).

Please fill out a [CARE Referral form](https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?MiracostaCollege&layout_id=1). Equipment will be loaned on a first-come, first-served basis. Once you've completed the form, the library will contact you with further information and pickup options.

### CARE Resource Guide for Basic Needs
It can be difficult to be present and maintain focus if you have challenges meeting basic needs such as a place to live, access to food, consistent transportation, and more. These challenges may impact your personal and academic success and we are here to help. Our Campus Assessment, Resources, and Education (CARE) program provides assistance with locating resources on- and off-campus to meet those basic needs. I urge you to speak with me so that I may submit a CARE referral on your behalf. You may also visit the [CARE website](www.miracosta.edu/CARE) or contact care@miracosta.edu for further support, resources, or information.
### Counseling Resources
As a student, there may be times when personal stressors interfere with your academic performance and/or negatively impact your daily life. If you or someone you know is having difficulty meeting basic needs such as food, housing, or transportation, or experiencing other personal and academic challenges, MiraCosta’s CARE Team is here to provide support and/ or help you get connected to appropriate resources. 
You may [fill](https://www.miracosta.edu/student-services/student-affairs/_docs/Guide%20for%20Supporting%20Students%20and%20Activating%20CARE%20Referral.pdf) out a [CARE referral form](https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?MiracostaCollege&layout_id=1) to request assistance, or schedule free mental health counseling sessions at [Health Services](https://www.miracosta.edu/healthservices) or by calling 760-795-6675. For after hours crisis management, you may call 1-888-724-7240. As a faculty member, I also may refer students about whom I am concerned to the CARE Team.  This is part of who we are as a caring, proactive community where we all look out for one another.
