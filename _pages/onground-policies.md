## Policy On Children In Class
Currently, the college does not have a formal policy on children in the classroom. The policy described here is just a reflection of my own beliefs and commitments to student parents:
- All exclusively breastfeeding babies are welcome in class as often as is necessary.
- For older children and babies, I understand that unforeseen disruptions in childcare often put parents in the position of having to miss class to stay home with a child. While this is not meant to be a long-term childcare solution, occasionally bringing a child to class in order to cover gaps in care is perfectly acceptable.
- I ask that all students work with me to create a welcoming environment that is respectful of all forms of diversity, including diversity in parenting status.
- In all cases where babies and children come to class, I ask that you sit close to the door so that if your little one needs special attention and is disrupting learning for other students, you may step outside until their need has been met.

Finally, I understand that often the largest barrier to completing your coursework once you become a parent is the tiredness many parents feel in the evening once children have finally gone to sleep. While I maintain the same high expectations for all students in my classes regardless of parenting status, **I am happy to problem-solve with you in a way that makes you feel supported as you strive for school-parenting balance. *Keep in mind, this is exactly why our grading and deadline policies are what they are!***

## Attendance
Note that if you do not attend the first 2 weeks of class you may be dropped from the course. Please reach out as soon as possible to avoid any miscommunications and issues.

Each week I’ll be checking everyone’s progress. If you’re missing class or assignments by the end of the week, you can expect me to reach out (in-person, our communication platform, email, Canvas message, etc.) to check-in and see how you’re doing. ***It’s very easy to fall behind, trust me I’ve been there as a student and faculty! My job this semester is to support you the way you need to keep you on pace to the finish line.***

By having a conversation, we can figure out the best way to support you so you can succeed in the class! **Do not assume, however, that you will be automatically dropped if you are not active in the class.** I will reach out multiple times to check-in, but ultimately it is your responsibility to withdraw from class in SURF before the appropriate academic deadline.
