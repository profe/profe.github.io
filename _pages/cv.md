Research experience
======
* **Mars Lava Formation Identification App**
  * *NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA, (Summer 2013)*
  * Developed a crowdsourcing prototype iPad application to gather Mars Lava Formation data for scientists at JPL. Aimed at middle school students or higher, it would teach students how to identify interesting formations and provide useful data to JPL. A student of mine from SMC (Santa Monica College) analyzed the crowdsourced data, through several data mining algorithms, to arrive at the best possible guess in identifying the formation.

* **Survey of Pointing Task Studies: How Are Motor Impaired Users Assisted?**
  * *University of Iowa (Fall 2011)*
  * Survey paper providing an overview of the techniques/algorithms that have been proposed and tested in the field of aiding a user with pointing tasks, such as adaptive CD-ratio and area cursor techniques. Specifically measures their usability and feasibility for users with motor impairments.

* **Helping a User Make Secure Choices – Case Study**
  * *University of Iowa (Spring 2011)*
  * Designed and performed user case studies to help users make secure choices in a more intuitive way by comparing a Linksys Router setup wizard against a custom setup wizard that was created for the study. Simulations created using HTML, JavaScript, PHP with a MySQL backend to log user choices for analysis.
