# I learn and teach through community, leveraging computing for liberation by empowering all oppressed peoples.

My focus each semester is to provide my students the best learning opportunities I can muster. That means constantly innovating teaching and learning approaches, while recognizing my human capacity and limits. I see my students as full, caring, beautiful, intelligent, and powerful learners. I rely on you heavily to guide me in how I can create brave learning spaces, I am the educator I am today because of the vulnerability so many have shared until now. I hope this semester you can help me grow as well, your vulnerability and effort are always appreciated. You inspire me to continue to live my passion for education and be the educator I wished I had.
