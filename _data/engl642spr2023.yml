number: ENGL 642
title: "Studies in Genre"
subtitle: "Science Fiction and the Man-Machine"
description: |
  This seminar will consider the history of American science fiction in the 20th century and will also focus on the human-machine relationship therein. We will not just consider robots, but also the cybernetic usage of people as machines and the creation of cyborgs (hybrids of human and machine). Students can expect to gain a better understanding of the development of a particular topic within a particular genre and to better understand the relationship between computation and culture in the 20th and 21st centuries.
