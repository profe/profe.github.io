Online CS101+CS112, first time CS226

CS226 (in-person)
======
First-time teaching this class I haven't seen in 15 years and failed the first time I took it. Wish us luck! XD

CS101 (online)
======
Amazing true introduction to CS that expects zero programming/CS experience! If you have programmed at all, consider another course

CS112 (online)
======
Java 2 course, can be tough online but GOALS in CS version helps with that. Stay engaged, connect with your classmates, and stay on top of each weeks materials!
